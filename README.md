# tdd_lab
Adopt a test-driven approach to develop a basic application in your preferred programming language. This application should perform addition on two positive integers. Your program should contain at least one method that adds these integers and returns the result.

Consider the following test cases.
* Case 1

When adding 2 integers where one of them is negative
Then display an error message
* Case 2

When adding 2 positive integers
Then display the accurate result of the addition of the 2 inputs
* Case 3

When adding 2 inputs where one of them (or both) are not integers
Then display an error message
For each case you should

Implement a test
Update your code so that the test passes
Have a separate commit / push to your GitHub repository.
